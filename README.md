## Project Description

This C/C++ project is a calculator program that can perform various operations on numeric inputs. What sets this calculator apart is that it can also handle inputs in written numbers and operators, in Romanian language. The program is interactive and uses the graphic library `graphics.h`.

The program can handle a range of operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It can also handle complex expressions that involve multiple operations and multiple numbers, including written numbers. 

For example, an input of "Cat este suma dintre 3, 4, 5 cu 7 minus 3" (meaning "What is the sum of 3, 4, 5, and 7 minus 3?") would output "saisprezece" (meaning "sixteen" in English). The program can also handle float values in the output.

To run the program, CodeBlocks is required, as well as the `graphics.h` library and a 32-bit compiler. 

## Usage

To use this calculator program, simply download and install CodeBlocks and add the `graphics.h` library to the project. Then, compile and run the program. You can enter any combination of written and numeric expressions, and the program will output the result in written form, in Romanian language.
