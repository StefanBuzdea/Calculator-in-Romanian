## Project Description

This C/C++ project is a calculator program that can perform various operations on numeric inputs. What sets this calculator apart is that it can also handle inputs in written numbers and operators, in Romanian language. The program is interactive and uses the graphic library `graphics.h`.

The program can handle a range of operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It can also handle complex expressions that involve multiple operations and multiple numbers, including written numbers. 

## Example

An easy example : input of "Cat este suma dintre 3, 4, 5 cu 7 minus 3" (meaning "What is the sum of 3, 4, 5, and 7 minus 3?") would output "saisprezece" (meaning "sixteen" in English). 
The program can also handle float values in the output.
More examples and rules of usage can be found on the Menu -> Rules page (appears when compiling). The Rules page looks like the one below:

## Requirements For Usage

To run the program, CodeBlocks is required, as well as the `graphics.h` library and a 32-bit compiler. 

## Usage

To use this calculator program, install CodeBlocks and add the `graphics.h` library to the project (needs to be downloaded too). Then, compile on a 32-bit compiler (can be installed and modified in CodeBlocks) and run the program. You can enter any combination of written and numeric expressions, and the program will output the result in written form, in Romanian language.
